FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 had done with Argentina as the champions of the competition. Argentina crowned as the champions after the intense final match against the defending champions, France, which ended in Argentina winning on penalties. Apart from that, there are many other facts to discuss about this year's world cup. On this occasion, I would like to analyze about all participating teams' data leading up to the World Cup 2022 compared to their placement in the competition.

## Analysis Plan

Given historical data leading up to the World Cup 2022, I would like to determine which countries are underperformed or overachieved in the World Cup 2022. To achieve the goals, my analysis focused into data about all participating teams' **FIFA Ranking**, **squads**, and **recent international match results**.

The dataset I used for this analysis is from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)
